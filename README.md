Blocks Google maps UI using a ublock origin filter list
there's still issues like the drop shadow at the top of the screen and the cursor, but I don't think you can disable that.

To install 
1.Copy the URL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tntmod54321/googlemapsuidisable/master/filter.txt"(without quotes)
2. Paste it into ublock origin -> options -> Filter Lists -> Custom -> Import
3. And finally click Save changes in the upper right hand corner

To disable it just uncheck the box under Filter Lists -> Custom -> Google Maps UI Disable
